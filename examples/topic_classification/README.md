# Topic Classification on the AG News Dataset

This example is intended to show you how to build the `train`, `test` and `infer` processes for the `AlectioSDK` for text
classification problems. We will use the [AG News](https://www.kaggle.com/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset) dataset. Each sample in this dataset is a news article. The objective is to identify the category that the article belongs to. The categories are as follows:

| label | topic |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1    | World | 
| 2     | Sports | 
| 3    | Business | 
| 4    | Sci/Tech | 

Since the size of this dataset is large, it shall be downloaded when the program is run.

*** All of the following steps assume that your terminal points to the current directory, i.e. `./examples/topic_classification` *** 

### 1. Set up a virtual environment and install Alectio SDK
Before getting started, please make sure you completed the [initial installation instructions](../../README.md) to set-up your environment. 

To recap, the steps were setting up a virtual environment and then installing the AlectioSDK in that environment. 

To install the AlectioSDK from within the current directory (`./examples/topic_classification`) run:

```
pip install ../../.
```

#### 2. Download the data and create a log directory
Create a log directory in the project root to save checkpoints and download the dataset in a separate `data` folder.
```
mkdir data && mkdir log
aws s3 sync s3://alectio-datasets/AG_News data
```
### 3. Build Train, Test and Infer Processes
The train, test and infer processes are implemented in [`processes.py`](./processes.py).

### 6. Build Flask App 
Finally, to run the flask app, execute:

```
python main.py --config config.yaml
```
## Return Types

The return from the `test` and `infer` will be sent to Alectio's platform for 
computing the model performance and making active learning decisions. 
Therefore, it is important to make sure that they have the expected format.

#### Format of the Test Outputs
Return from the `test` process will be used to compute performance metrics of
your model. The return is a dictionary with two keys

| key | value |
| --- | ----- | 
| predictions | a dictionary of test data index and model's prediction |
| labels | a dictionary of test data index and its ground-truth label | 

For classification problem, the model's prediction and 
the ground-truth of each test sample is an integer indicating the class label.

For example, if the test set consists of `(n + 1)` samples indexed by `(0, 1, ..., n)`,
then the value of `predictions` looks like
```python
{
    0: x0,
    1: x1,
    ...
    n: xn
}
```
where `xi` is the integer class label of sample `i` predicted by the model. 

The value of `labels` looks like
```python
{
    0: y0,
    1: y1,
    ...
    n: yn
}
```
where `yi` is the integer ground-truth class label of sample `i`.

#### Format of the Infer Outputs
Return from the `infer` process will be used to understand which data points to labeled
in the next step.

```
outputs_fin = {}
for j in range(len(outputs)):
    outputs_fin[j] = {}
    outputs_fin[j]["prediction"] = predicted[j].item()
    outputs_fin[j]["pre_softmax"] = outputs[j].cpu().numpy()
```

The above code block can be used as a template. Here, the returned items should be a dictionary with
the following information for each batch: predictions by the model, and the activations of the penultimate layer.

Finally, after filling that up, we return the result of the `infer` step like so:
```
return {"outputs": outputs_fin}
```
